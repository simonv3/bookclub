# An Internet Enabled Book Club

The code for http://simonv3.github.io/bookclub/

A book club where you choose what book you read and then - if you liked it - send it via the snail mail to the next person.

Every month we'll rotate the list and you'll randomly get assigned a new person to send your book to.

So here's how it works:

1. You sign up
2. Someone already on the list vouches for you
3. Every month we randomly assign everyone a new person to send their book to
4. If you're new, you send a recently read book, or a favorite book to the next person
5. You read the book you just received
6. Repeat

This is a bit of an experiment, but if everyone is genuine, it should work out!

Warning! This will involve sharing your address with possibly a complete stranger on the Internet.
We will vet every person who joins this list before letting them participate, but if this is something that makes you uncomfortable or could impact your safety, this is probably not for you.
We have a Code of Conduct, but once that person has your address we can't take it away from them.
It might be worth getting a PO Box.
